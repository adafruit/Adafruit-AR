Our fastest Metro ever - the NXP i.MX RT1011 microcontroller powers this board with a 500 MHz ARM Cortex M7 processor. There's 4 MB of execute-in-place QSPI for firmware + disk storage and 128KB of SRAM in-chip.

Currently there we have support for using this board with CircuitPython. There is no Arduino support at this time.

The boot mode switches (labeled BOOT SEL on the board silk) are used to get into the ROM bootloader. The switch has two individual switches: B0 and B1. The photo shows both switches in the OFF position, but for normal operation B0 should be OFF and B1 should be ON.

The individual switches are set to ON (or 1) when they are moved next to the ON text on the switch housing and OFF (or 0) when they are moved next to their labels on the board silk. You can find more information on entering the bootloader with these switches on the Installing the Bootloader page in this guide.

This JST SH 4-pin STEMMA QT connector breaks out I2C (SCL, SDA, 3.3V, GND). It allows you to connect to various breakouts and sensors with STEMMA QT connectors or to other things using assorted associated accessories. It works great with any STEMMA QT or Qwiic sensor/device. You can also use it with Grove I2C devices thanks to this handy cable.

In CircuitPython, this port can be accessed with board.STEMMA_I2C().

This is used for both powering and programming the board. You can power it with any USB C cable. When USB is plugged in it will charge the Lipoly battery.

The following pins are related to power on the Metro M7 1011:

3.3V - this is the output from the 3.3V regulator, it can supply 500mA peak.

5V - this is the output from the 5V regulator (when DC jack is used), or from USB. It can supply ~500mA peak from USB and ~800mA peak from DC.

GND - this is the common ground for all power and logic.

VIN - this is the higher of the DC jack or USB voltage. So if the DC jack is plugged in and 9V, Vin is 9V. If only USB connected, this will be 5V.

The WiFi capability uses an Espressif ESP32 Wi-Fi coprocessor, aka the AirLift, with TLS/SSL support built-in. Communication is over SPI and it has CircuitPython library support ready to go for fast wireless integration with the following pins:

- MOSI pin (board.ESP_MOSI)
- MISO pin (board.ESP_MISO)
- SCK pin (board.ESP_SCK)
- CS pin (board.ESP_CS)
- Ready/Busy pin (board.ESP_BUSY)
- Reset pin (board.ESP_RESET)
- ESP RX/TX pins (board.ESP_RX and board.ESP_TX) are shared with the M7 RX/TX pins. There's a resistor between the M7's RX line and the ESP32 module so that a device connected on the RX pin will override the communication from the ESP32 module.
- You can also connect to the ESP32 RTS pin (used in some serial contexts) on board.ESP_RTS
- The ESP32 GPIO0 pin for bootloader enable is connected to board.ESP_GPIO0
